# Research plan for the Summer.
Lu Yi proposed three projects to work on, and i like the framing of that. I have based the structure of this plan from the notes
on our meeting you sent me.
Some general ideas from Arvid:
I would like to apply a "multiverse" approach as discussed in [this article] (http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/multiverse_published.pdf)
This approach has been used in other contemporary genetic research, such as in [Border et al]

## Project 1 - Dissecting the age of onset trait in the UKBB

### Step 1)  what are the genetic components influencing MDD age-of-onset?
Pretty straightforward. Find genetic variants related to age of onset. 

Statistical analysis:
1) Conduct a GWAS on the age of onset trait in UKBB (Done by Lu Yi), using FastGWA, which
retains all individuals, even those who are related?
2) LD prune and check if these are close to proteincodin genes?
3) Q: Would it be interesting to use genetic correlations to compare to other psychiatric illnesses?

### Step 2) To what extent does this AAO phenotype overlap w disease risks
If i understand this correctly, this question is about the relationship between age of onset and other diseases?
And statistical analysis on this question would be epimiological models?

Statistical analysis:
1) Does age of onset predict other diseases?
2) Is age of onset predicted by other things, such as BMI, SES, etc?

### Step 3)
In this step we generate a PRS from the FASTGWA on age of onset, and see if it predicts disease severity in MDD, and 
it's relationship to other psychiatric illnesses.
Suggestion by Arvid: If possible, we could either 1) exclude all siblings in UKBB, and then check between- sib prediction
of PRS. Or even better, see if PRS predicts differences between DZ twins in STR.
